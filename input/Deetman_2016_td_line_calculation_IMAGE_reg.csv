"# Title: Deetman et al. (2021) methodology for calculating high, medium, and low voltage lines in the 26 IMAGE3.0 regions."
# Line length in km
"# Description: Deetman et al. compiled data on high voltage lines from various sources (OpenStreetMaps calculation by the authors for 2016), various national studies (2013-2017), and Arderne et al. (2019). From high voltage line length, they used ratios to calculate medium and low voltage lengths. The values used in Deetman et al. are used as inputs, while the rest of the data is preserved here for reproducibility."
