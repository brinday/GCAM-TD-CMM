"# Title: Deetman et al. (2021) share of underground lines for high, medium, and low voltage lines by IMAGE3.0 regions"
# % underground
"# Description: Deetman et al. used an empirical relationship to calculate percent share of high, medium, and low voltage lines underground (vs. overhead), as a function of per capita GDP. For high voltage, the relationship is pct_underground_HV = 0.0009*PCgdp - 15.102. For medium voltage, the relationship is pct_underground_MV = 0.0016*PCgdp - 4.769. For low voltage, the relationship is pct_underground_LV = 0.0016 + 7.5104."
